# CSE450 - ALS Assistive Tech Device
This is the official readme for the ALS Assistive Tech Device project, it contains all information regarding the overall functionality and design of the system, as well as instructions for construction and use of the system.

# Introduction
This project is a design for a device to assist communication and provide access 

# Purpose and Goals
## Purpose
The purpose of this assistive technology device is to empower individuals living with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) by providing them with an innovative tool to overcome communication barriers and gain greater control over their immediate environment. Recognizing the unique challenges faced by ALS patients, this device is meticulously designed to facilitate easy and effective interaction, even with limited physical mobility.

## Goals
### Enhanced Communication:

To offer a reliable text-to-speech functionality that allows ALS patients to communicate their thoughts and needs verbally, using minimal finger movements.

To ensure that the text-to-speech process is intuitive, quick, and requires minimal effort, catering to the specific needs of individuals with varying degrees of motor skills.

### Environmental Control:

To provide the capability to control electronic devices such as televisions and room outlets, enabling users to maintain autonomy over their living space.

To design a user interface that is simple to navigate, ensuring that switching between different controls (e.g., TV, lights, and other appliances) is seamless and requires minimal physical exertion.

### Customization and Accessibility:

To include customization options that allow the device to be tailored to individual preferences and requirements, ensuring maximum comfort and usability.

To ensure that the device is accessible, taking into account the diverse range of abilities and challenges faced by ALS patients.
Technical Reliability and Safety:

To ensure the device's technical reliability, providing consistent performance without frequent maintenance.

To adhere to the highest safety standards, minimizing any risks associated with the use of the device.

### Empowerment and Independence:

To empower ALS patients by providing a tool that enhances their ability to interact with others and control their environment, thereby improving their quality of life.

To promote independence and dignity for ALS patients, offering them a means to express themselves and manage their surroundings without constant reliance on caregivers.
